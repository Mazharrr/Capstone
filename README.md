Our goal for our MVP was to have a character that could be controlled, an AI that would behave in a certain way to attack this character, and the ability for the character to kill the AI and vise-versa

There are two AI that we added so far. One of them functions as planned, whereas the other doesn't work yet. There are also some animations that we need to work on even on our MVP


To run:
npm install
npm start
