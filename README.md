Hello everyone,

PaintWars is a fast-paced but accessible game that hobbyists and newcomers can casually enjoy in their spare time. As a modern spinoff of the classic arcade game Bomberman, we've added new mechanics to make PaintWars distinct and one to call our own.

This project was a great opportunity for us to leverage our understanding and implementation of React and Redux while also exploring some libraries we hadnâ€™t used before.

To move: W,A,S,D Keys or Arrow Keys
To drop a paintbomb: Space Button

To run game:
  - npm install
  - npm run build-watch
  - then in another terminal tab: npm start

Or, feel free to play the game on heroku:

Enjoy!

Best,
Andres, James, and Mazhar
